.Sh CAVEATS
The return value of
.Fn u8len
does not necessarily represent the number of human-preceived characters
in the given buffer;
multiple codepoints may combine to form one human-preceived character
that spans a single column.
To count user-preceived codepoints
.Pq also known as graphemes ,
you may want to use the
.Xr u8glen 3
function.
